<h1>Make Your Own Words</h1>
<h2>One of the coolest things about Logo is that you can make
your own words that do whatever you want them to do. When you
make a word, you can use it in other commands and programs just
as if it was part of Logo to begin with.</h2>
<h2>What if we want to draw a lot of squares. Each time we have
to type in:</h2>
<blockquote>
    <h2>REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]</h2>
</blockquote>
<h2>That's not a whole lot of typing, but wouldn't it be nice if
we could just type:</h2>
<blockquote>
    <h2>SQUARE</h2>
</blockquote>
<h2>You can teach LOGO what a &quot;SQUARE&quot; is like this:</h2>
<blockquote>
    <h2>TO SQUARE<br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT 90]<br>
    END</h2>
</blockquote>
<h2>Now we can use our new word to make cool new programs. Can
you figure out what this does?</h2>
<blockquote>
    <h2>REPEAT 36 [SQUARE RT 10]</h2>
</blockquote>
