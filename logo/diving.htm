<h1>Diving</h1>
<p>I started diving when I was 16. My family built a pool in the
backyard with a little 6 foot board. It was only about 12 inches
above the surface of the water, but I practiced on that little
board nearly every day during the summer. I figured I was the
world champion on the 0.3 meter board. I would practice jack
knives, dives with half twist flips, back flips, 1 and 1/2's,
gainers and half gainers, and even double flips.</p>
<p>That was some 20 years ago, but I again have a pool - this
time with a 1 meter board. But I've lost some of my fearlessness
(unless my peers are around to goad me on), so I don't do the
double flips without a wet suit. I can pretty much do all the old
dive though.</p>
<p>When I was at MIT, Charlie Batterman was still giving diving
instruction (though I wimped out joining the team). You may have
seen the photographs of him diving into the MIT pool that were
taken by Harold Edgerton in the early days of high-speed
photography. I also found that Charlie wrote an excellently
illustrated diving book. I made this AVI from one of the pictures
in his book.</p>
