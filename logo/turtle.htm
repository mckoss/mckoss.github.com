The turtle looks like a little triangle in the middle of the screen. The head shows you which 
direction he is facing. When the turtle moves he draws a line behind him.<br clear=all>

You can turn the turtle by telling him to turn RIGHT or LEFT. This pictures 
shows how to make the turtle turn in different directions. Instead of typing out 
RIGHT and LEFT I use the smaller words RT and LT, which mean the same 
thing to the turtle.<br clear=all>

<p>To get the turtle to draw a line, just tell him to move FORWARD a number of steps (turtles take small steps, so you 
need to tell him to move FORWARD many steps, like 100, to get him to move enough to see). I like to use the 
smaller word FD instead of typing FORWARD. Both work the same way.<br clear=all>

To get the turtle to draw a shape, like a square, you 
can give him the instructions he needs to &quot;walk&quot; around 
the shape of a square.<br clear=all>
