    <p align="left">Unfortunately, I didn't get to fly on this trip.&nbsp; 
    Although I had brought myself up to currency for IFR flight, I didn't feel 
    very safe flying on instruments over the mountains.&nbsp; And with the 
    weather we were having, there was no way to get out of the WA/OR area w/o 
    crossing mountains IFR.</p>
    <p align="left">No matter - I found a pretty reasonable commercial air-fare 
    on Saturday and bought an e-ticket for a flight out Sunday morning.&nbsp; I 
    must say, it was great to get our of the rain-soaked NW for a week.</td>
