    big news this year is that we started the design and construction of our new
    home on Hunts Point.&nbsp; <a href="xmas98.htm">Last year</a>, we
    anticipated a move-in date of Christmas 2000 - we've now pushed that back to
    May 2001.&nbsp; For much of the year we've been having weekly meetings with
    our architects to make enough decisions to hire a contractor and get the
    project started.&nbsp; On October 22nd, we were able to break ground!&nbsp;
    If you would like to see pictures of the building project as it unfolds,
    just check out <a href="http://mckoss.com/kossres">http://mckoss.com/kossres</a>
    (we even have a web-cam on site for up-to-the-minute status).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">We were able to squeeze in a <a href="cruise99/">Caribbean
    cruise</a> during Chris's spring break.&nbsp; Chris had a blast with his
    friend Sean from school as they had their own cabin and free-run of the
    ship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">On June 23rd Deb and I celebrated our
    20th wedding anniversary!&nbsp; We spent the weekend in San Francisco.&nbsp;
    A special treat of the trip was attending an MIT alumni dinner at which we
    were able to meet Buzz Aldrin (the <i>second</i> man to set foot on the
    moon), Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the Web), and Bob Metcalfe (inventor of
    the Ethernet network).&nbsp; Deb and I sat at Buzz's table.&nbsp; Having
    read about the phenomenon of seeing &quot;flashes&quot; of light that was
    first detected by Buzz during the Apollo 11 mission, we were able to ask him
    about it over dinner.&nbsp; Apparently the effect is subtle, but present
    even with eyes closed.&nbsp; They believe that gamma radiation occasionally
    impinges on the retina creating a visible flash of light; we don't see this
    on earth due to the protection provided by the earth's atmosphere.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">We went back to Oklahoma City for
    Debbie's 20th high-school reunion.&nbsp; She was able to catch up with old
    friends and it was especially great to see the bridesmaids from our wedding
    all together at the reunion picnic.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">A highlight of our summer was our
    week-long visit with friends in Maui.&nbsp; Deb and I spent one morning kayaking
    in the open ocean - we even met up with a sea turtle as we paddled back
    home.&nbsp; The whole group took a trip along the back road to Hana.&nbsp;
    This route cleverly skirts the literally hundreds of hairpin curves that
    plague the primary route.&nbsp; We had an adventure diving from high rocks
    and crawling behind a large waterfall.&nbsp; We even made a visit to <a href="http://mckoss.com/bookstore/default.asp?Section=Aviation#0399144498">Lindberg's</a>
    grave.&nbsp; Somehow I let myself get talked into driving back from Hana on
    the main road - it <i>really is</i> as bad as I had remembered...hours and
    hours of turn after turn after turn.&nbsp; Everything else about the trip
    was wonderful, thankfully.&nbsp; Imagine my horror when our friend's
    daughter Acacia approached me in the morning, &quot;Drive me to Hana,
    Mike?&quot;.&nbsp; Nooooo!</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Chris decided to take up a new
    instrument this year - the saxophone.&nbsp; He's picked it up quite quickly
    and we enjoyed watching his first band concert of the year in November.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Another treat for me has been being
    able to add to my collection of cryptographic machines.&nbsp; To date, I've
    collected a German Enigma, a US Army M-209, and a Swiss NEMA machine.&nbsp;
    I hope to display them properly in the library of our new home.</font></p>
