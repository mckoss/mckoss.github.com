<p align="center"><font size="4">A web-based photo gallery project</font><br>
by Mark Jennings, Mike Koss, and Darrell Plank</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Image Gallery</b> is a client-side JavaScript program 
that allows you to create a slide-show presentation from a collection of 
pictures.&nbsp; To create a new gallery, you need only copy a simple template 
file, and edit the XML data block contained in the file to reference your 
images.</p>
<p align="left">The <b>Image Gallery Designer</b> is a windows application that 
simplifies the creation of the correct template file format, and allows you to quickly 
select and crop the images for your show.&nbsp; The folder containing the slide 
show HTML file and final images and thumbnails is created for you to be 
copied to a web server for distribution.</p>
<h2 align="left">Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Cross-fade transitions between images.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Supports mixed portrait and landscape format images with optimal 
on-screen layout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Easy-to-navigate thumbnail images</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Title, Date, and description for each image.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Optional background music can play 
during the show.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">A gallery can sequence automatically between images by hitting 
the Play button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Optional &quot;Home&quot; button to link back to 
a parent web site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Easy to create with Designer application.&nbsp; You can specify 
cropping and thumbnail rectangles for each image.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Simple to deploy.&nbsp; Just drag a single folder to your web 
server containing the gallery template file and the associated images.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">The entire gallery is represented as a 
single HTML file; unlike other slide shows, the browser's Back button will 
return you to the originating web page rather than having to back up through all 
the images you've viewed so far.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Images are downloaded in the background 
while you are viewing other images - so there is less waiting to jump from one 
image to the next.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Documented XML-language description of 
a gallery allows for creation of galleries with other tools, or by manually 
editing the XML in a sample gallery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0">Support for pop-up viewer for larger 
resolution image file</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="screenshot2.jpg" width="426" height="537"></p>
<p align="left">The Image Gallery is currently under development.&nbsp; There 
are several releases of the software so far.&nbsp; We welcome <b>Beta Testers</b> 
- so please try it out  and let us know what you think.&nbsp; Click on 
the version&nbsp; link below to select the version you'd like to try (we'd 
obviously recommend you trying the most recent version).</p>

		your gallery.&nbsp; This directory contains all the files and images 
		that are required to run the Image Gallery run-time application 
		(viewer).<blockquote>

		<p>Note that your first action in the application is to create a 
		gallery.&nbsp; Then you can drag images from your system into the 
		thumbnail view.&nbsp; You'll find two rectangles you can drag to form 
		the large image crop, and a separate image crop for the thumbnail.</p>
		<p>Once your gallery is created on your local machine, you can publish 
		it by copying yourshow.htm and all the *.jpg files in the gallery folder 
		to your web server (note - you should NOT copy the folder called 
		&quot;Processed Images&quot; - that is only for use when editing your gallery 
		should you decide to open it in the Designer again).</td>
