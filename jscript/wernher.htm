Braun was born into a prosperous aristocratic family. His mother encouraged 
young Wernher's curiosity by giving him a telescope upon his confirmation in 
the Lutheran church. Braun's early interest in astronomy and the realm of 
space never left him thereafter. In 1920 his family moved to the seat of 
government in Berlin. He did not do well in school, particularly in physics 
and mathematics. A turning point in his life occurred in 1925 when he 
acquired a copy of Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen ("The Rocket into 
Interplanetary Space") by a rocket pioneer, Hermann Oberth. Frustrated by his 
inability to understand the mathematics, he applied himself at school until 
he led his class.

In the spring of 1930, while enrolled in the Berlin Institute of Technology, 
Braun joined the German Society for Space Travel. In his spare time he 
assisted Oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests. In 1932 he was graduated 
from the Technical Institute with a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering and 
entered Berlin University.

By the fall of 1932 the rocket society was experiencing grave financial 
difficulties. At that time Capt. Walter R. Dornberger (later major general) 
was in charge of solid-fuel rocket research and development in the Ordnance 
Department of Germany's 100,000-man armed forces, the Reichswehr. He 
recognized the military potential of liquid-fueled rockets and the ability of 
Braun. Dornberger arranged a research grant from the Ordnance Department for 
Braun, who then did research at a small development station that was set up 
adjacent to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test facility at the 
Kummersdorf Army Proving Grounds near Berlin. Two years later Braun received 
a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Berlin. His thesis, which, for 
reasons of military security, bore the nondescript title "About Combustion 
Tests," contained the theoretical investigation and developmental experiments 
on 300- and 660-pound-thrust rocket engines.

By December 1934 Braun's group, which then included one additional engineer 
and three mechanics, had successfully launched two rockets that rose 
vertically to more than 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometres). But by this time there 
was no longer a German rocket society; rocket tests had been forbidden by 
decree, and the only way open to such research was through the military forces
. 

Since the test grounds near Berlin had become too small, a large military 
development facility was erected at the village of Peenemünde in northeastern 
Germany on the Baltic Sea, with Dornberger as the military commander and 
Braun as the technical director. Liquid-fueled rocket aircraft and jet-
assisted takeoffs were successfully demonstrated, and the long-range 
ballistic missile A-4 and the supersonic anti-aircraft missile Wasserfall 
were developed. The A-4 was designated by the Propaganda Ministry as V-2, 
meaning Vengeance Weapon 2. By 1944 the level of technology of the rockets 
and missiles being tested at Peenemünde was many years ahead of that 
available in any other country.

Work in the United States. 

Braun always recognized the value of the work of U.S. rocket pioneer Robert H
. Goddard. "Until 1936," said Braun, "Goddard was ahead of us all." At the 
end of World War II, Braun, his younger brother Magnus, Dornberger, and the 
entire German rocket development team surrendered to U.S. troops. Within a 
few months Braun and about 100 members of his group were at the U.S. Army 
Ordnance Corps test site at White Sands, N.M., where they tested, assembled, 
and supervised the launching of captured V-2s for high-altitude research 
purposes. Developmental studies were made of advanced ramjet and rocket 
missiles. At the end of the war the United States had entered the field of 
guided missiles with practically no previous experience. The technical 
competence of Braun's group was outstanding. "After all," he said, "if we are 
good, it's because we've had 15 more years of experience in making mistakes 
and learning from them!"

Moving to Huntsville, Ala., in 1952, Braun became technical director (later 
chief) of the U.S. Army ballistic-weapon program. Under his leadership, the 
Redstone, Jupiter-C, Juno, and Pershing missiles were developed. In 1955 he 
became a U.S. citizen and, characteristically, accepted citizenship 
wholeheartedly. During the 1950s Braun became a national and international 
focal point for the promotion of space flight. He was the author or coauthor 
of popular articles and books and made addresses on the subject.

In 1954 a secret army-navy project to launch an Earth satellite, Project 
Orbiter, was thwarted. The situation was changed by the launching of Sputnik 
1 by the Soviet Union on Oct. 4, 1957, followed by Sputnik 2 on November 3. 
Given leave to proceed on November 8, Braun and his army group launched the 
first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, on Jan. 31, 1958.

After the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was formed to 
carry out the U.S. space program, Braun and his organization were transferred 
from the army to that agency. As director of the NASA George C. Marshall 
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Braun led the development of the large 
space launch vehicles, Saturn I, IB, and V. The engineering success of each 
of the Saturn class of space boosters, which contained millions of individual 
parts, remains unparalleled in rocket history. Each was launched successfully 
and on time and met safe performance requirements.

In March 1970 Braun was transferred to NASA headquarters in Washington as 
deputy associate administrator for planning. He resigned from the agency in 
1972 to become vice president at Fairchild Industries Inc., an aerospace 
company. In 1975 he founded the National Space Institute, a private 
organization whose objective was to gain public support and understanding of 
space activities.

In attempting to justify his involvement in the development of the German V-2 
rocket, Braun stated that patriotic motives outweighed whatever qualms he had 
about the moral implications of his nation's policies under Hitler. He also 
emphasized the innate impartiality of scientific research, which in itself 
has no moral dimensions until its products are put to use by the larger 
society. During his later career Braun received numerous high awards from U.S
. government agencies and from professional societies in the United States 
and other countries.
