      has been an interesting year for us. We&#146;ve done quite a bit of travelling together.
      In the spring, we went spent a <a href="http://mckoss.com/italy98">week in Italy</a>. We
      started in Rome, but spent the bulk of our time in Florence. We all enjoyed the art,
      architecture, and perhaps most of all, the food (especially Italian gelatto). We took
      several trips by train &#150; everything from the high-speed pendulum train to
      &quot;locals&quot; between small towns.</p>
      <p>Mike started weight lifting and hiking in preparation for a climb up Mt. Rainier. He
      made it to the summit &#150; but only just barely (climbing from sea level to over 14,000
      ft. in one day gave him a nasty case of altitude sickness). For more details visit
      http://mckoss.com.</p>
      <p>In the summer, we went back to Oklahoma City for Mike&#146;s 20<sup>th</sup> high
      school reunion and then accompanied his father to Newberry, Michigan for his 40<sup>th</sup>.
      Chris and Debbie got to see Manastique Lake and the cabin where Mike was born.</p>
      <p>On his free weekends, Mike built Chris a &quot;<a
      href="http://mckoss.com/platformhouse">tree-house</a>&quot; this summer. Actually, since
      we have no trees, he had to build it on stilts. It stands 10 feet in the air, has a shake
      roof, a balcony and even electricity!</p>
      <p>Chris went to three sports camps this summer (basketball, baseball, and roller hockey)
      before starting at a new school this year. He started 5<sup>th</sup> grade at Overlake. He
      will be at this new school through high school. He&#146;s really enjoying it. Not only
      does he love his teachers, he&#146;s really enjoyed taking math, social studies and Latin.
      He&#146;s also started playing (drums) in the school band. He played in his first band
      concert in December.</p>
      <p><img SRC="images/plathouse.jpg" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="144" align="right" hspace="8"
      vspace="8">Mike did a lot of business travelling this year, recruiting for Microsoft in
      Pittsburgh and twice to MIT/Boston, and then a week-long visit to Tokyo in December to
      interview customers (through an interpreter!).</p>
      <p>In September, we decided to look for waterfront property to build a new house. We were
      fortunate to find a really great lot on Lake Washington. There is no house on the site, so
      we are working with an architect now to design our new home. We expect to finish design by
      this summer and start construction in the fall. It&#146;s exciting and a bit scary. We
      should be able to move in around December 2000!</font><font FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE="1"></p>
