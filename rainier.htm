<p></font><font size="3"><b><font face="Verdana">Preparation</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">In mid-March I found that my friends Jim Mallahan and Jeff Lum
were planning to climb Mt . Rainier. &quot;Want to join us?&quot;, they asked me casually.
After a couple seconds of thought, I said &quot;Sure, why not.&quot; So we all signed up
for a guided climb of Mount Rainier with <a href="http://www.rmiguides.com/"> Rainier Mountaineering Inc.</a> (RMI).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">My primary motivation for doing this climb was to have an excuse
to get into shape. For the next four months I started a regular program of twice weekly
weight lifting and a weekly hike. Unfortunately, Jeff had to drop out due to a back
injury, but Jim and I continued so that by July 21<sup>st</sup>, we felt well prepared for
the climb.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">On Monday night, we drove to Paradise Lodge for a good night's
sleep before our trip. We ate a big breakfast at the Lodge dining room and walked over to
the RMI guide house at 9AM. By 10:30 everyone in the group (23) had their equipment rented
and we made our introductions. Our group consisted predominantly of people living out of
state; we even had a honeymooning couple from California.</font></p>

<img src="images/Mike_and_Jim.JPG" alt="Mike and Jim.JPG (27728 bytes)" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right" width="400" height="267"><font face="Verdana">The first day of the climb took us from
Paradise (5,500&#146;) to Camp Muir (10,000&#146;). By this time, my pack weighed about 40
lbs. Jim and I had hiked to Muir once before in training, but my pack had been far
lighter. Now, I had crammed it full of every item on the RMI checklist, including 4 pairs
of gloves or mittens, headlamp, batteries, food for two days, two quarts of water as well
as crampons and an ice axe hanging off the back.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The weather for the trip could not have been more ideal. Dressed
in shorts and T-shirts, our group made the hike to Muir in about 5 hours. We had one
person turn back on this relatively easy part of the trip (perhaps due to the heat or
heavy load). And another needed to go at a slower pace than the rest of the team (tiny
Hong&#146;s pack was just about as large as she was).</font></p>

<p>
<img src="images/Mike_at_Muir.JPG" alt="Mike at Muir.JPG (15611 bytes)" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="240" height="228"><font face="Verdana">Jim and I both felt great at Muir. The pace was
slow and steady with 4 rest stops along the way. We had time to prepare a meal of noodles.
I couldn&#146;t understand why some people told me that the altitude took away their
appetite. I felt really hungry and my noodles tasted great.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Verdana">Rest Period</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">After dinner, we were all commanded to go to bed at 6 PM. Packed
like sardines in the one-room bunk house 22 people lay quietly for the next 5 ½ hours. I
doubt anyone in the group was able to get more than an hour of sleep; I wasn&#146;t able
to sleep at all.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Verdana">Summit Climb</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">At 11:30 the lights came on. We had to get ready to go. After
having a meal they euphemistically called breakfast we started out on our summit climb.
Outside the bunk house the night sky was the most beautiful I&#146;ve seen. We had no
moon, the skies were crystal clear, and we were looking through 10,000&#146; less of the
atmosphere than at sea level. The Milky Way was particularly striking. Rather than just
sense a vague fuzziness in the background blackness of the sky, you could discern
intricate details of the structure of the Milky Way, with a large dark band running down
the middle (caused by interstellar clouds of gas, I believe).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Each of our 5 rope teams assembled on the snow outside the
bunkhouse. We began by crossing the Cowlitz Glacier to Cathedral Gap (10,500&#146;). This
part of the route is visible directly from Muir. One of my most memorable sites is looking
at the lights from the headlamps of the teams in front of mine. Their points of light
formed their own constellations in the dark sky above me, and I could see the Big Dipper,
every bit as bright as the light from the headlamps, hanging over the head of the lead
team.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Once across the glacier (including our first step over a small
crevasse) we scrambled through a very rocky section (no snow) up to the Ingraham Flat
(11,000&#146;). This was our first rest stop. I was working hard, but I still felt pretty
good at this point. I believe, however, that one or two people turned back at this point.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The next section of the climb was the most dangerous. We had to
walk across the Ingraham glacier, including two very large crevasses. There were aluminum
ladders laid across the crevasses for this purpose. Even though we were roped together, it
was quite thrilling to take 4 or 5 steps across the wooden planks while looking hundreds
of feet down into the crevasse.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">But the most dangerous part was traversing underneath the Ingraham
Ice Fall. We were all told to be quiet and move as quickly as possible. If we saw falling
rock we were told not to run but to &quot;step out of the way&quot; at the last second.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Once across, we climbed through the rocky Disappointment Cleaver
up to 12,400&#146;. It was at this rest stop than another 6 people turned around
(including Jim). I had a headache, and the beginnings of nausea and I was asked if I was
still able to make the climb. I had to decide not only for myself, but also if I would
remain an asset to my rope team and not be a liability. I decided that I could be; I still
felt strong, but just a little ill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The next section seemed really difficult to me. It was long, and
the pace was relentless. I was getting increasingly sick to my stomach and I was finding
some of the spots quite scary. Much of the trail is a well worn trough. On one side, is a
wall, on the other, a small ridge falling away in a steep slope. Climbing in the trough is
difficult; even though I was wearing crampons my feet would sometimes slip backwards,
requiring excess energy to catch myself from slipping and to regain the ground of the
wasted step.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">So I used a technique they called &quot;duck walking&quot;.
Instead of walking in the trough, you walk on the ridge. Each step is placed at a 45
degree angle to the right or left of the ridge peak. The ridge is made of relatively
frozen packed snow so that it is easy to jam your crampon down and get a very solid
footing. When done right, it feels as easy as climbing stairs. The problem for me was that
this placed my footing at the edge of a sometimes very steep slope; if I misplaced a step,
I could lose my balance and fall down the slope. It also placed me further from the
opposite wall and made it difficult to use my ice axe as a cane on it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">I think our last rest stop was at 13,500&#146;. At this point were
were switching back and forth on the very steep upper slopes of the Ingraham Glacier. Here
the snow lies at an angle of up to 40 degrees. It feels damn near vertical. Just to lay my
pack down, I have to place it above my planted ice axe to keep it from sliding away. At
this point I feel pretty crappy and I throw up my breakfast and trail mix. My head feels
like I have a permanent ice-cream headache.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">But at this point there is no turning back. We are going to make
the summit, sick or not. My sickness is taking it&#146;s toll on my energy level and I
start to really feel exhausted. Most of the time, the rope in front of me is being pulled
taut as I fight to go a little bit slower than the guide of my rope team; the guy in front
of me is in some measure pulling me up the mountain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">About an hour later I saw what looked like the crater rim. But Jim
had warned me, that as you approach the summit you will see what you think is the top, but
in actuality you will have to continue on much further. So I am steeled to expect that we
have quite a ways to go. In fact, for the last hour, I&#146;ve felt that I couldn&#146;t
possibly go on another minute, and yet I had many hours of climbing and descending to go.</font></p>

<p>
<img src="images/Mike_at_Summit.JPG" alt="Mike at Summit.JPG (21275 bytes)" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="400" height="267"><font face="Verdana">To my surprise and happiness, we
actually were at the crater rim. I had made it! It was now 7:30 AM, 14,400&#146;. The rim
was barely 20 feet above the floor of the crater and we all walked down and unhooked
ourselves from our rope. We will spend a 1-hour break period here at the summit. I puke
again &#150; this time relieving my self of yesterday&#146;s dinner and more trail mix.
After bundling up with every piece of warm clothing I had, I spent some time taking
pictures, and calling family and friends using a cellular phone. I&#146;m afraid I scared
my mother into thinking I was actually dying with all the pressure breathing I was doing
(it&#146;s better to breath with loud puffs of air at altitude in order to pressurize the
air in your lungs to absorb oxygen).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">While other members of the party explored the crater, or sat
around talking, I lay on my pack feeling exhausted, sick, and shivering uncontrollably.
All too soon we had to begin our descent.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Verdana">The Descent</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">At the end of each rest period we have to decide how much clothing
to wear for the next hiking interval. Once the team is under way, there is no stopping for
anything short of an emergency. That initial decision can mean the difference between
discomfort and extreme discomfort.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">I had chosen to wear a polar fleece shirt on top of my long
underwear for the initial descent. This was a big mistake. The sun was now up and I was
baking. At least the level of exertion required to walk down is much less than going up.
The main problem is balance. We were trained to use a &quot;plunge step&quot;. Each step
is a little crouch into the snow while driving your ice axe into the snow at your side to
help you stabilize your step. It&#146;s very easy to slip and loose your footing, so it
makes it a bit more tiring than simply walking down a flight of stairs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The view from the top coming down was amazing. Looking down the 40
degree slope you could see the vast landscape of glacially carved valleys surrounding Mt.
Rainier. Because of the pitch, it felt almost as if you were looking strait down as if
hanging from a balloon. The view was absolutely unobstructed by intervening trees or
ground.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Now in the light, we can really see all the terrifying spots we
have just climbed in the dark. The most exposed heights have permanent ropes attached to
the glacier so we can clip into them as we pass. The ice fall area is also more hazardous
now that the sun is out, warming and melting the glacier. We again move quickly and
quietly past this area.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">One interesting thing we got to witness on the way down was the
intentional dislodging of a boulder. The team behind us found a wobbly boulder hanging
right over a part of the Disappointment Cleaver trail. We all stood back as they pushed it
off it&#146;s perch. This large stone, some 3 feet across came crashing down the trail.
Each bounce was accompanied by a loud &quot;whap&quot;. I could just imaging the amount of
energy of each impact as the boulder of many hundreds of pounds fell 20 to 30 feet between
caroms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">We were also passed in this same area by a team of two unroped
climbers. Apparently they had spent the night in the crater, and had done all their
climbing unroped and unprotected. This really drew criticism from our guides. Simon then
told us some 150 climbers in France are killed each year due to this attitude. The
European tradition of climbing places more emphasis on climbing freely and without safety
devices.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">We reach Camp Muir by noon. This feels like the end for me, but in
fact I have to repack my pack with all 40 pounds of gear, and we have another 2 ½ hours
to go to Paradise. We made a good time of it by running down (almost skiing on the
slippery snow), and sliding down on our butts. There are actually &quot;slides&quot; in
the snow built up by all the people that have been doing this already.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">I think I got more blisters from our mad dash to the guide house
than I did on the whole previous part of the trip. It is especially jarring once we reach
the bare dirt trail and paved walkways of the lower park.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Verdana">Conclusion</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">I feel proud to have accomplished this climb; it feels like the
hardest and most intense thing I&#146;ve ever done. In a 30 hour period, I climbed
9000&#146; of Mt. Rainier and back again under my own power and without sleep. But it was
a painful and exhausting experience as well. I couldn&#146;t really recommend it to anyone
unless you're in really excellent condition &#150; it&#146;s something you have to decide
for yourself to do. I don&#146;t think I&#146;ll ever attempt it again.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Questions and Answers (<SCRIPT>PostMail("mike03", "Mike Koss");</SCRIPT>)</font></b></p>
</font>

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>How'd you lose your camera?</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">My camera stayed in the crater, I think.&nbsp; I was feeling so
crappy I must have left in on the ground and it never made it into my backpack for the
return.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Update: It turns out I did <strong>NOT</strong> lose the camera -
it was in a pocket of my jacket...I only found it when it next rained and I had to use it;
&quot;what is this buldge in my pocket?&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>Did the honeymoon couple make it?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The husband made it - the wife had to turn back.&nbsp; She was
pretty scared of the exposed nature of the climb.&nbsp; Hong did not make the summit as
well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>How many of the original 23 actually made it to the top?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Only 14 clients of the 23 that started the trip made it to the
summit.&nbsp; This is a lower than normal percentage, especially taking the great weather
into account.</font></p>
