<p>In the summer of 1998, I decided to build my son a tree house.&nbsp; Actually, since we
have no real trees our our property, it was to be a platform house - built on stilts.
&nbsp; Chris was 9 years old.&nbsp; Two years ago, we had donated his old play set to his
school.&nbsp; At the time, his terms were that we replace the playset with something else;
something like a tree house.&nbsp; I let one summer go by without holding up my end of the
bargain, so this year I felt compelled to actually do something.</p>

<p>While I was building this project, I talked to a number of other people that said that
their fathers had built them a tree house at about the time they were Chris's age. &nbsp;
It seems to me that making a play house like this, fills some inner need on the part of
the parent.&nbsp; We know that our child is soon going to be becoming more
independent.&nbsp; Yet we want to keep them close.&nbsp; And we know that they are still
at an age where they would actually &quot;play&quot; in a playhouse.&nbsp; We want to
create for our child his own private world - yet one into which we can still play a part.</p>

<p>I've been accused of being a big child myself - so of course building this house was
something I was very interested in all on my own; Chris has given me many convenient
excuses over the years for indulging my child-like impulses.</p>

<h2>Planning the Project</h2>

<p>I had never built a livable structure before; the closest I've come is watching shows
about deck building.&nbsp; So, I figured a platform house could not be much more
complicated that constructing a deck, putting it up on very tall supports, and then
framing a little shed-like structure on top.</p>

<p>I started buying books about tree houses and deck building.&nbsp; The two best books on
tree houses I've found have been by Peter Nelson.&nbsp; Peter also lives in Seattle.
&nbsp; At many points I was sorely tempted just to call Peter and see if he would build
our tree house for us.</p>

his books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0395629497/mikekoss"><em>Treehouses</em></a>,
is an incredible collection of photographs of inspiring tree houses.&nbsp; The center of
the book shows a detailed sequence of photographs of Peter building a 200 square foot
octagonal jewel perched 30 feet up an old growth fir in British Columbia.&nbsp; This book
contains some history of tree house building and some detailed drawing and sequence for
his BC project.&nbsp; But mostly, this book provides <em>inspiration</em>.&nbsp; The
houses and photography in the book are gorgeous (if you like tree houses!).&nbsp; See
Peter's company web site, <a href="http://www.treehouseworkshop.com">TreeHouse Workshop</a>,

while not as beautiful as the first, provides much more in the way of practical advice on
tree house construction.&nbsp; It describes how to put up walls, windows, and doors.
&nbsp; How to actually suspend and support a house in a tree.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there
is nothing in this book about building up in the air with <em>artificial</em> support.
&nbsp; Lacking a tree, we needed to make our own supports and had to make them both strong
enough and rigid enough to provide a comfortable platform for our construction.</p>

Sunset books.&nbsp; The first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0376010878/mikekoss"><em>Complete Deck Book</em></a>,
had great information on how to build the basic platform.&nbsp; Since many decks are a bit
raised off the ground (though usually attached to a house on at least one side), it also
had some good info on supporting our platform.&nbsp; I got my computations on structural
loading from this book (deciding how big the joists and beams needed to be to support the
platform, house, and occupants).<br clear="all">

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0376015802/mikekoss">Basic Carpentry</a></em>
as a source of information from everything about nail selection to framing a wall, and
installing a roof.&nbsp; This is the book I used most <em>at the job site</em> to help me
make the day to day decisions about the materials I'd need and how to accomplish the basic
building tasks.<br clear="all">

<img src="images/Floor%20Plan%20Sketch.JPG" alt="Floor Plan Sketch.JPG (8625 bytes)" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" width="200" height="132">Chris and I started out the project with a
blank sheet of paper in May of 1998.&nbsp; What would it look like?&nbsp; We decided to
build a platform that was 8 feet by 10 feet. &nbsp; I figured it would be easy to do the
flooring with 4' x 8' sheeting of some sort if we kept one dimension to 8 feet.&nbsp; But
we also wanted to have a little balcony on the end of the building so you&nbsp; would be
able to be outside when you were up in the air, and not feel you were trapped in a little
box.&nbsp; We figured we could build the house about 8 feet in the air - I figured I could
get posts of that length easily.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/Elevation%20Sketch.jpg" alt="Elevation Sketch.jpg (18157 bytes)" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" width="288" height="200">I started sketching a little 8' x 8' cabin
with a 2' balcony, a roof, and a beam that would extend off the balcony to support a
hoist/pulley system for pulling stuff up into the house.&nbsp; We also planned that the
main entrance would be through a trap door in the floor, and that we would build some sort
of rope ladder to climb into the house. &nbsp; Being up so high, we knew that the legs
would need some sort of bracing to keep the platform rigid.&nbsp; It turns out that we
needed quite a bit more bracing than we originally planned, but we started out our plan
with a standard &quot;Y&quot;-bracing to add some stiffness to the support structure.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/Floor%20Plans.jpg" alt="Floor Plans.jpg (19628 bytes)" align="left" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="240" height="392">We also decided to build out some interior
furniture.&nbsp; Chris would want some built-in bunk beds.&nbsp; And his dream was to be
able to be up in the tree house and play video games up there with his friends.&nbsp; So
we planned on wiring it for electricity, building in bunk beds and some desk surfaces for
video game machine and television. &nbsp; We drew three possible floor plans which we
needed to choose between in order to plan the placement of the door to the balcony.&nbsp;
Chris chose &quot;Plan 3&quot;.</p>

<p>Next came the detailed drawings and construction.&nbsp; This was very much a
learn-as-you-go project.&nbsp; I'd decide to build something, figure out from the books
what kind of lumber was needed, draw some sketches to make sure I understood how things
would fit together, and then build it.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/">Home
Depot</a> was my hang-out for the next couple of months.&nbsp; I got to know Amy, one the
the checkers there quite well over the summer and she would ask me each weekend how the
tree house was coming along.<br clear="all">
</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>The first project phase was to build the platform itself.&nbsp; I assembled all the
lumber for the platform framing on the ground.&nbsp; I could attach all the joist hangers
to the main support beams on the ground instead of trying to do this once the beams were
raised up into the air.&nbsp; This went relatively quickly and the basic platform shape
and trapdoor took shape.&nbsp; Now it was time to venture to Home Depot again for the
&quot;legs&quot; of our platform house.</p>

<p>I went expecting to buy 8' long 4&quot;x4&quot; pressure treated posts.&nbsp; But, to
my surprise, they also stocked much longer pieces.&nbsp; They had 10' and 12' long posts.
&nbsp; Perhaps some even 14' long.&nbsp; Cool!&nbsp; The more height, the more fun. &nbsp;
After weighing the added difficulty of building higher, I compromised on the 10'
posts.&nbsp; High enough to really feel that you are &quot;up in the air&quot; but not so
high as to make reaching the structure with a normal step ladder impossible.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/Platform%20Box.JPG" alt="Platform Box.JPG (20704 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="240" height="180">After attaching posts to beams, raising the legs required
the help of some neighbors. &nbsp; The Albertson's were kind enough to come over and lend
a hand.&nbsp; This felt like a traditional barn raising to me.&nbsp; While the neighbors
held the legs in place, I scurried up a ladder to nail in two joists to make the basic box
suspended in the air. <br clear="all">
<br clear="all">
<img src="images/Squeezer.JPG" alt="Squeezer.JPG (15266 bytes)" align="left" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="200" height="150">I was not satisfied with how secure the joists were resting in their
hangers when we were done - there was a gap of about 1/4&quot; between the end of each
joist and the beam.&nbsp; To fix this, I came out the next morning and rigged up a
&quot;squeezer&quot;. &nbsp; By wrapping a rope around the structure and twisting with
dowel, I was able to pull the two beams up snug against the joists and then reset the
nails holding them in.&nbsp; I was now able to complete the &quot;Y&quot; bracing, making
a more rigid structure.<br clear="all">
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/Post%20Tie.JPG" alt="Post Tie.JPG (6255 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="100" height="161">We dug holes where the legs should go, and I poured four
concrete footings with embedded post ties.&nbsp; Again the neighbors came back and helped
lift the legs up unto the posts and we bolted them in place.&nbsp; After hauling all the
remaining joists up and nailing into place the basic platform frame was completed.&nbsp;
The next trial was getting the floor decking installed.&nbsp; I had not realized how scary
it would be to be over 10 feet in the air working on a very open framed structure.&nbsp;
It also swayed a bit.&nbsp; Ten foot posts are not as stiff as I though they would be and
the whole structure would oscillate quite easily as you moved around it or bumped against
it.</p>

<p>Each sheet of 4' x 8' flooring weighed about 80 lbs. (or so it felt).&nbsp; Deb helped
hold the ladder as I climbed up with each sheet and threw it on top of the platform.
&nbsp; Chris and I both then nailed the flooring into place.&nbsp; We now had a completed
&quot;deck&quot;, 10 feet in the air.&nbsp; But it was quite wiggly and very scary to be
standing up there.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/Wall%20Plan.jpg" alt="Wall Plan.jpg (27989 bytes)" align="left" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="400" height="317">Now was time to actually plan the framing of the building
itself.&nbsp; This took quite some time to figure out how to make the frame, learn how to
frame a window, and be sure that I could build the roof/rafters on top.&nbsp; After
purchasing the 2&quot;x4&quot;s, I built all the walls in the driveway.<br clear="all">
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/Frame%20in%20Driveway.JPG" alt="Frame in Driveway.JPG (24595 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="160" height="120">Framing proceeds rather quickly, and I was
able to assemble the frame for the tree house on the ground, with all the sections tied
together with string.&nbsp; It was quite fun to walk around inside the frame and get a
feeling for the size of the room-to-be.<br clear="all">
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/Frame%20on%20Platform.JPG" alt="Frame on Platform.JPG (28589 bytes)" align="left" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="240" height="320">Again, we had to haul these quite heavy
walls up onto the platform.&nbsp; Again both Debbie and rope came in handy.&nbsp; About
this time, Gerry Albertson again came to the rescue.&nbsp; Being in the construction
business, Gerry owns portable scaffolding.&nbsp; He let me borrow it for much of the
summer.&nbsp; Now I could wheel a portable 16 foot high platform around to any side of the
tree house to help install siding, place the window, and install the roof.&nbsp; I don't
know how I could have completed this project without it.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult things to figure out was how to attach the rafters.&nbsp; I
had at first thought I would notch out each piece with a triangular cut called a
&quot;bird's mouth&quot;.&nbsp; The problem is, determining exactly where to make this
cut, and at what angle so that the rafter rests squarely on the top of one wall while it
attaches to the ridge beam.&nbsp; This was much harder (for me) than it sounds.&nbsp; I
finally gave up and bought special metal ties that eliminate the need to notch the rafters
at all.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/Scaffolding.JPG" alt="Scaffolding.JPG (25814 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="240" height="320">With rafters in place, I nailed 4'x8' sheets of siding up
into place and nailed all the walls together.&nbsp; Having the building framing in place
added a bit more stiffness to the structure but it was still quite wiggly.&nbsp; I
considered pouring some more concrete footings and attaching buttress-like supports to
each of the legs.&nbsp; Eventually, and more simply, I was able to add additional
cross-bracing from mid-span to the base of each leg.&nbsp; This was able to add the
stiffness that was needed and it now feels quite solid.&nbsp; We brought up an old window
from our house and nailed it into place in the west-wall opening.</p>

<p>The roofing was something I really knew nothing about.&nbsp; I decided to install cedar
shingles across the roof, with no underlayment - I figured it would be <em>pretty
waterproof</em>, although may not be perfect.&nbsp; It was now August, and we were
starting to get some really hot weather in Seattle.&nbsp; There's nothing like sitting out
in the sun on a hot roof in the summer.&nbsp; I was glad we at least did not live in
Texas, who in 1998 had temperatures over 110 degrees.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/From%20the%20Roof.JPG" alt="From the Roof.JPG (12185 bytes)" align="left" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="160" height="120">I calculated that I installed 500 shingles
and drove 1000 nails.&nbsp; I did all this without the aid of a nail gun.&nbsp; That was a
mistake.&nbsp; Due to my, I'm sure, poor technique, the knuckles in my right hand still
ache from the jarring they received doing all that hammering.<br clear="all">
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/Side%20Elevation.JPG" alt="Side Elevation.JPG (23569 bytes)" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" width="240" height="320">With the roof installed, I then built and
hung the door, and built the balcony railing (copying the style of the railings used on
the deck of our house).&nbsp; With the exterior complete, we built two bunk beds, a desk,
and four shelves inside.&nbsp; Finally, in September/October I was able to complete wiring
for lights and electrical outlets. &nbsp; Debbie purchased foam and covered them to make
cushions for the bunk beds.</p>

<p>Everything complete, Chris and I impatiently decided to sleep out in the tree house
that night.&nbsp; It was November, and about 25 degrees outside.&nbsp; Man, was it cold.
&nbsp; Chris was able to sleep through most of the night, but I was tossing and turning.
&nbsp; The total cost of materials was about $2000 (about $25/square foot - not counting
labor).&nbsp; I spent another $400 on tools, books, and videos during the project.</p>

<p align="left">Now, we've bought some property and are planning on building a house for
ourselves. &nbsp; We're going to have to figure out how to <em>move a platform house</em>
in a couple of years!<br clear="all">
