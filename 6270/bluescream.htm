<p align="left">The organizers of MIT's 6.270 invited Microsoft to participate
in this year's robot competition as a corporate sponsor.&nbsp; This gave us about two weeks before we had to fly to 
Boston, and another 5 days in the lab on campus before the day of the final 
competition.</p>
<p align="left">We were able to demonstrate correct orientation and effective
ball stealing (getting balls from the opponents side of the table and bringing
them to our own side) in the lab; but we failed to do as well in the lighting
conditions during the competitions.&nbsp; I'd attribute this to running out of
time to work the bugs out of the software - we didn't really stabilize our
hardware platform and were making changes so late that we were not able to adapt
and debug completely.</p>
<p align="left">But we did have fun making a <i>placebo</i> program which we ran
during contest day.&nbsp; Our placebo would spin around, whack it's gate on the
table, and pop wheelies.&nbsp; Unfortunately (but hilariously), by placing our
batteries in a spot conducive to wheelies, we also made our robot very likely to
fall over on it's back; which it did in each of the demos in front of an
audience.</p>

      <p>We received our box of robot parts.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some of the
      (high current) batteries got loose in shipping and shorted out.&nbsp;
      Luckily, it only charred some batteries and didn't burn up the whole box!</td>

      <p>Note that reflection from the flash reduces the contrast between the
      blue and white sides of the boards noticeably; this is the reason we positioned
      our look-down sensor and illuminator at an angle to the table rather than
      have it look straight down at the table.</td>
