<h1>Foundation Drawing</h1>
<p>In the fall of 2003,&nbsp; Debbie and I enrolled in a beginning drawing class 
at the <a href="http://www.realistart.com/">Seattle Academy of Fine Art</a>.&nbsp; 
The goal of the class is to teach how to draw realistically, using pencil 
(graphite) and charcoal.&nbsp; I've posted some of my drawings from this class 
below (I've also posted some of <a href="debfoundation1.htm">Debbie's drawings</a>).</p>
<p>In the winter quarter (2004), our portrait drawing instructor is posting all 
in-class student work&nbsp; work on
<a href="http://www.artbuilding.com/artD0402/">his web site</a>.&nbsp; You can 
seen some of our drawings there (as well as drawings <i>of us</i> done by other 
students!).</p>
